# Melange tutorial

In this tutorial you will learn how to make executable languages and how Melange can help you to write generic algorithms for a familly of language thanks to Model Type.

We will first design 4 differents languages close enough that we would write one tool for all of them, and then will do it !

##Â Variants of language

### What is a Finite State Machine

#### Targeted FSM languages

### Designing languages

#### Simple FSM

##### Modeling

##### Weaving aspects

#### Others FSM

##### Timed FSM

##### Composite FSM

##### Timed composite

## The Melange world

### New project

### Interface of language : the Model Type

### Transformation?

## Conclusion

In this tutorial you learnt how to add behavior on a language and used Melange to write a generic algorithm for different (but close) languages.
