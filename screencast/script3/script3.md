Melange Part 3: Advanced Aspects

15. Now we need to connect FSM to MiniLang
16. Firstly create a new Xtend file

17. We define an aspect on FSM
18. Add a reference to Context
19. Set it as containement
20. We add a block of statements into State
21. And an expression on Transition
22. We then extend existing aspects to redefine semantinc parts
23. Process each statement when executing State
24. import static extension to set Aspect methods visibles
25. Eval expression to activate Transition
26. And finally import the glue in the language
27. New containements are added to the syntax
