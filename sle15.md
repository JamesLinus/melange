Note: some breaking changes have been introduced in the latest versions of Melange. We will be back in time with an updated companion webpage.

Melange can be installed in an [Eclipse installation for DSL developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-and-dsl-developers/marsr) using the following update site: [https://ci.inria.fr/k3al/job/melange-master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/releng/fr.inria.diverse.melange.p2updatesite/target/site/](https://ci.inria.fr/k3al/job/melange-master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/releng/fr.inria.diverse.melange.p2updatesite/target/site/).

The archive file containing the Eclipse workspace used for the case study can be downloaded [here](http://melange-lang.org/SLE15.tar.gz).
