TODO
----
[ ] Metamodel/ModelType attributes and operations
[X] Improves the subtyping algorithm so that it takes aspects into account
[X] Manage subpackages
[ ] Automatically find the root(s) of metamodels
[X] Allow inheritance between metamodels (partially)
[ ] Multiple inheritance/subtyping semantics? e.g. w/o aspects, partial, etc.
[ ] Allow multiple inheritance of metamodels
[ ] Allow the import of multiple Ecore files in a metamodel declaration
[X] Allow the definition of model types independently of any metamodel
[ ] Register to the EMF notification system (eg. 2-ways list adapters)
[ ] Support non-isomorphic subtyping via renaming clauses
[X] Allow arbitrary return types for transformations
[ ] Create models from scratch using the generated factories
[X] Manage (potentially cyclic) dependencies in the matching algorithm (partially)
[X] Support metamodels making use of external references (to be checked)
[X] Allow import of Ecore for modeltype definition
[ ] Automatically merge different Ecore inherited and/or imported
[ ] Write static semantic constraints on the abstract syntax
[ ] Manage annotations on Ecore file to specify which elements need to be exposed by the interface
[X] Expose methods signatures in the interface
